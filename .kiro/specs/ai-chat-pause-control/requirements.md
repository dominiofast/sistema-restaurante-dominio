# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a selective pause control for the AI chat system, allowing operators to pause AI responses for specific clients while maintaining normal AI functionality for all other clients. The system currently has a pause button that doesn't work properly - the AI continues responding even when paused. This feature will fix that issue and implement proper client-specific pause controls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer service operator, I want to pause the AI for a specific client, so that I can handle their conversation manually without AI interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an operator clicks the pause button for a specific client THEN the AI SHALL stop generating responses for that client only
2. WHEN the AI is paused for a client THEN the AI SHALL continue responding normally to all other clients
3. WHEN the AI is paused for a client THEN the system SHALL store the pause state persistently
4. WHEN the AI is paused for a client THEN the operator SHALL see a clear visual indication that AI is paused for that specific conversation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer service operator, I want to resume AI responses for a paused client, so that the AI can take over the conversation again when I'm done with manual handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an operator clicks the resume button for a paused client THEN the AI SHALL resume generating responses for that client
2. WHEN the AI is resumed for a client THEN the pause state SHALL be removed from storage
3. WHEN the AI is resumed for a client THEN the visual indication SHALL change to show AI is active
4. WHEN the AI is resumed for a client THEN the AI SHALL be able to respond to new messages immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer service operator, I want to see the current pause status for each client, so that I know which conversations are being handled manually vs automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the chat interface THEN the system SHALL display the current AI status (active/paused) for each client conversation
2. WHEN the AI is paused for a client THEN the pause button SHALL show a "resume" state
3. WHEN the AI is active for a client THEN the pause button SHALL show a "pause" state
4. WHEN switching between client conversations THEN the correct pause status SHALL be displayed for each client

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the pause state to persist across system restarts, so that manually paused conversations remain paused even if the system is restarted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system restarts THEN previously paused clients SHALL remain paused
2. WHEN the system restarts THEN previously active clients SHALL remain active
3. WHEN a client is paused THEN the pause state SHALL be stored in the database
4. WHEN the system loads THEN it SHALL retrieve and apply all stored pause states

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a customer service operator, I want to prevent accidental AI responses when paused, so that I don't confuse customers with mixed manual and automatic responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI is paused for a client AND a new message arrives THEN the AI SHALL NOT generate any response
2. WHEN the AI is paused for a client AND the operator is typing THEN the AI SHALL NOT interrupt with automated responses
3. WHEN the AI is paused for a client THEN all AI processing for that client SHALL be completely disabled
4. WHEN checking if AI should respond THEN the system SHALL verify the client is not paused before processing
